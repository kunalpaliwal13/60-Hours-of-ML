Bias – Variance Tradeoff

Bias – difference btw real n predicted value

Variance – amount of estimate of target function change bw different points

By adjusting bias and variance we can have an optimized error

- Techniques to have proper bias- variance tradeoff
  - Good model selection: too simple- underfitting, too complex – overfitting
  - Regularization – used when model overfits
  - Reducing dimensionality
  - Ensemble methods- used for underfitting

Loss Function 

How far the estimated value is from true value

Types: 

- Cross entropy loss
- Squared error loss
- KL divergence
